# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

🖌️ UI/UX Design: Designed with Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and animation, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing user experience.
🛎️ Real-time Notifications: Utilized React Toastify for instant feedback on actions like adding to cart or removing items.
📊 Admin Dashboard:
Super Admin & Local Admin Accounts: Manage all user details, assign roles, and handle user permissions.
